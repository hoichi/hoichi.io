Oy vey. It’s bad enough that the ReasonML standard library, Belt’s preference for fast pipes is polarizing the community (regular pipes are way more customary in Caml, and of course ReasonML attracts a lot of Caml enthusiasts), now I learn [it’s not even the same fast pipe](https://github.com/facebook/reason/issues/2118#issuecomment-411529634)!

The horror! The drama!
