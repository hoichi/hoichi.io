Hi y'all. If you read this, that means I've started my little developer’s blog that doubles as a project because ~~none of [those static site builders](https://www.staticgen.com/) are any good~~ I need to build something to learn JS and Node. _And_ [reading code is harder` than writing](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html).
  
Here's [the repo](https://github.com/hoichi/hoichi.io), if you're curious. It's pretty messy and pretty much everything screams for rewriting, but it's a start.
