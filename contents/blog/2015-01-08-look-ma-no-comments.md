Ok, since this blog is experimental anyway, I've decided to experient some more and go without comments, at least for now. The first reason, to be honest, is I've played with [Muut](https://muut.com/) (don't get me started on things like Disqus), aaand it's somewhat hard. Much as I'm intrigued by [Riot](http://riotjs.com/) from the same authors, overriding a whole lot of Muut's css rules is boring (and none of those`!important`s are particularly easy on these poor eyes).

There goes my idea of having a fully static site _and_ comments. If (or when) I decide to roll my own comments, I'm gonna need a DB, user authentification and a whole lot of stuff I haven't even begun to think about. Not to mention paying for Heroku or whatever.

But I need to learn all those things anyway. Hard things. Useful things. Sure, one of the reasons I'm starting a blog is that networking is supposedly good for your career. But for the time being I need to acquire skills way more than I need to make myself known. If I can't even code a simple comments section, what's the point of talking to me anyway?

And sure, even as a noob I might use some feedback on that trivial stuff I might write right now. But maybe the lack of easy communication channels like comments (or, say, Twitter) will help me start putting parts of my experiments into publishable chunks, and _that_ will get me more meaningful feedback than those bite-sized recipes on using Gulp plugins.

And if not, I'm just going to have to learn how the comments are coded, isn't I?
