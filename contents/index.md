Hi there.

Name's Hoichi. More like Sergey Samokhov IRL, but who needs RL anyway.

I'm probably the world's oldest aspiring JavaScript developer and [here is my blog](/blog/). Which, as you might have noticed, is kind of a glorified `Hello world` so far.

A self-referential `Hello world` too: what I'm mostly building these days (besides my dayjob with [Timepad](https://welcome.timepad.ru)) is this very site. I’m even taking part in that trendy [100 Days of Code](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.pht91268n) movement, because I’m on top of things. [Here’s what’s up](/100/) (TL/DR: not much).
