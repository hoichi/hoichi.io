Hi there.

Name's Hoichi. Well, more like Sergey Samokhov IRL, Moscow born and bred, but that's beside the point.

Point is, I'm probably the world's oldest aspiring JavaScript developer and [here is my blog](/blog/). Which, as you might have noticed, is kind of a glorified `Hello world` so far.

A self-referential `Hello world` too: what I'm mostly building these days (besides my dayjob with the fine folks @ [Timepad](https://welcome.timepad.ru)) is this very site. So what should I post about if not this. You can see the repository [here](https://github.com/hoichi/hoichi.io) and be blown away of how huge a mess can hide inside so few lines of code.

Then again, I should start with _something_, right?
