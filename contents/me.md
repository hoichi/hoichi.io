I’m Sergey Samokhov, or hoichi for short, a maturish aspiring frontend developer from Moscow, Russia. I work with React, TS & Apollo, but am also very interested in FP, TDD, and basically all those CS foundations I lack.

I also love fiction, poetry, music, Masaaki Yuasa & Johhny To.

I’m `hoichi` on [GitHub](//github.com/hoichi) and [Medium](//medium.com/@hoichi). I’m also [hi@hoichi.io](mailto:hi@hoichi.io).

In another life, I’d probably be a novelist. Or a drummer. In this one, there’s still too much code-fu to learn.
