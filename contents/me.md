I’m Sergey Samokhov, an ever-aspiring frontend dev from Moscow, Russia, severely fascinated by FP and, you know, all that programming sorcery. Most of my XP is with React & TS, but boy, does that ReasonML thing looks neat. But anyway, I’d like to learn to see _through_ the technology.

I also love fiction, poetry, music, languages Masaaki Yuasa & Johhny To. And my son and wife. Especially my son and wife.

I’m `hoichi` on [GitHub](//github.com/hoichi) and [Medium](//medium.com/@hoichi). I’m also [hi@hoichi.io](mailto:hi@hoichi.io).
