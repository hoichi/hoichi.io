My name is `hoichi` (aka Sergey Samokhov) and I’m a living flotsam. Half of my life I’ve been shunning developer’s path, refusing my call. Yet here I am, washed up on a shore and humbled flat, nowhere to go but inside™.

Could be a worse shore, I guess. Could be mr. Jones’ locker. Could lose my life, not just [my ears](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoichi_the_Earless).

Still, so much time wasted. So much to learn.
