Made a test build script and tried a simple `<engine>.observeSource().dest()`, still with `js-csp` for transport. Took me long enough to figure out my OOP basics, but it kinda works. Kinda. A few immediate bugs emerged, but that’s a good thing. A slightly less good thing is I’m still not sure about the architecture. But given how lame I still am it’s a miracle I can build anything at all.

One bad thing is I haven’t got around to figure out [that Ava/chokidar clash](/100/day-7-8/). But then I’m so unsure about anything that I would probably abstain from TDD at this stage anyway (static types _and_ learning TS on the go is quite enough for now). And the silver lining here is you can log with WebStorm breakpoints without littering your code with `console.log()`s, and that speed things up a bit.
