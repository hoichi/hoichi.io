So, working every day didn’t happen. What happened is life. Also, I need to focus better (and sleep more).

That aside, I’ve started to jot down all the interfaces for the data that my engine should pass through itself. What I wanted to find out was whether there is some underlying abstraction to all those pages, templates &c. What I found out is I suck at TypeScript and don’t have the first idea how my engine should work or where to begin. Again.

Well, written some specs on _how_ it should work, done some figuring out of TS interfaces syntax. Rolling on.
