Spend the last two days (what few hours of them I’v actually played with my project) trying to find out why doesn’t my [chokidar](https://github.com/paulmillr/chokidar) watcher emit anything. Found out it has something to do with AVA, because here’s my (simplified) test:
 
 ```JS
 import test from 'ava';
 import * as chokidar from 'chokidar';
 
 var watcher  = chokidar.watch('test/', {
     ignored: /[\/\\]\./,
 });
 
 var log = console.log.bind(console);
 log(`Initial cwd: ${process.cwd()}`);
 process.chdir('D:\\dev\\chops');
 log(`Changed dir to: ${process.cwd()}`);
 
 watcher
     .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
     .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
     .on('ready', () => log(`Initial scan complete. Ready for changes`))
 ;
 
 /*
 // Comment when calling from Node directly,
 // ’cause Ava tests won’t run without Ava cli.
 // Uncomment for Ava cli, ’cause Ava trows when there’s no tests.
 test('...', t => {
     console.log('AVA out, bye');
 });
 */
 ```

Here’s the log when I run `node build/sourceWatcher.test.js`:

```
Initial cwd: D:\dev\chops
Changed dir to: D:\dev\chops
Directory test/ has been added
Directory test\contents has been added
Directory test\contents\blog has been added
File test\contents\index.md has been added
File test\contents\blog\2015-01-07-hello-world.md has been added
File test\contents\blog\2015-01-08-look-ma-no-comments.md has been added
File test\contents\blog\json-to-jade-via-gulp.md has been added
Initial scan complete. Ready for changes
```

And here goes `node_modules/.bin/ava build/sourceWatcher.test.js`:

```
Initial cwd: D:\dev\chops\build
Changed dir to: D:\dev\chops
Initial scan complete. Ready for changes
AVA out, bye
```

Yes, I’m on Windows. Maybe that’s one of those [officially advertised](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) `fs.watch()` Windows problems. Maybe I should install Ubuntu and see if the problem persists--and see if my repo is self-sufficient in the process. 

I _should_ install some Linux, even though last time I tried Mint & Kubuntu I coulnd’t get the fonts to not look like shit--including the fonts in WebStorm. But that will wait. For now I think I’ll ask around for solutions, maybe read up on file system issues in Ava repo and then at least wait for Ava 0.17, where [they promise](https://github.com/avajs/ava/blob/master/docs/recipes/debugging-with-webstorm.md) WebStorm debugger compatibility, before investigating further.

Sure, that means I can’t unit test about the only code I’ve written for the project--not with _Ava_, at least--but I’ll figure something out. Maybe try switching to _Tape_ for a while (I _think_ the syntax would be mostly compatible). Or put Ava aside, write some temporary tests in plain JS and try logging with WebStorm watches. Or start implementing and testing something else. It’s not that I’ve run out of things to do.

Also, I think syntax highlighting on my site is broken. But that will wait as well.
