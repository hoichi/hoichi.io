I’m taking part in that [100 Days of Code](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4#.pht91268n) flashmob. Sort of. No Twitter, no repo cloning, just me and my lonely, commentless blog. Which doubles as my coding project, because I’m narcissistic and lack imagination. I should have chosen something frontend-related too. React, most likely. But I have no sense of direction either. Also, no ears. Hoichi desu. どうぞ　よろしく おねがいします.
