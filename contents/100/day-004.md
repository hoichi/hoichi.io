Brainfart of the day: trying to `return` from a `readFile` callback. Async as fuck.

That’s when it dawned on me that I’m gonna have to use promises to go with my observables. Haven’t decided whether to use Bluebird yet: [fs-jetpack](https://github.com/szwacz/fs-jetpack) has them baked in, and I was planning to use fs-jetpack for file creation anyway.

Yes, I’ve been away from my little engine that could. Sick and all (and still going to my day job). Here’s hoping I’m back.
