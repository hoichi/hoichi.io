Firstly, I should probably stop trying to do things at the expense of sleep, health, being alert at my dayjob--or being there for my family. It’s not even a matter of values and priorities. It simply doesn’t work.

Secondly. Tried to substitute [CSP](http://jlongster.com/Taming-the-Asynchronous-Beast-with-CSP-in-JavaScript) for RxJS. Surprisingly, it worked at first try (should I be worried?). Written my first ES6 generator, while I was at it. In the process learned that [you cannot](http://stackoverflow.com/a/32345220/2658546) use `yield` inside an arrow function. Welp. Given that CSP is supposed to be our best bet against the callback hell, and all the examples I’ve seen so far look extremely synchronous-like and pretty readable in the linear fashion (they might all be overly simplistic, of course, and I probably have yet to see the most hardcore stuff), shouldn’t be too much of a problem.

I still think ReactiveX could align with my project pretty well, but somehow js-csp clicked with me immediately, which is something I cannot say about RxJS. And since js-csp:
- presumably solves more problems
- looks more concise 
- _and_ makes your code more concise
- _and_ seems way easier too learn

...I think it makes a lot of sense to have it in my toolbox anyway. Even if I have to learn RxJS as well eventually.

And now let’s code some basic features already.
