Phase one of my phase one is a phase done. I’d pat myself on the back if I wasn’t so afraid to scare myself shitless. So far my test script looks kinda verbose (at the very least, I’m going to need `.patch()` in addition to `.convert()`):
 
```js
chops
    .src('**/*', {cwd: 'contents'})
    /* necessary defaults */
    .convert(page =>    Object.assign({
                            // category: 'blog',
                            date: new Date(),
                            published: true,
                            title: 'Untitled'
                        }, page))
    /* processing yfm */
    .convert(page => {
        var yfm = fm(page.content);
        return yfm.body
            ? Object.assign({}, page, yfm.attributes, {content: yfm.body})
            : page;
    })
    /* markdown conversion */
    .convert(page => Object.assign({}, page, {
        content: md.render(page.content)
    }))
    /* destination url */
    .convert(page => Object.assign({}, page, {
        url: Path.join(
                page.url || Path.join( (page.category || page.path.dir), page.slug ),
                'index.html'
            ) || 'untitled/index.html'
    }))
    .write('build') // that’s test/build
;
```

Still, I decoupled and streamlined some shit, I caught some silly bugs and I got at least some stuff out of the way. Now to the more interesting stuff:
- Level one: watching for templates, compiling them, and then re-render pages on both template events and content events.
- Level two: adding pages to collections and rendering collections too.
- Level three: make collections buffer page events on initial scan so we don’t do too much re-rendering.

I think somewhere between levels two and three I’m gonna get around to cleaning up my TS definitions and writing some AVA tests. Or maybe I’ll publish the module after level two (or at least `npm link` it) and start dogfooding it for realsies. Either way, levels one and two are advanced enough, so let’s get there first.
