What is wrong with my fabric? I forgot how to even create objects in JS. At least I’ve set up Babel. Not the speediest setup for development, but it’s not the only thing that is wrong with my projects.

Yesterday I learned that code like this breaks way too easily:

```js
_p.excerpt = /<p>(.*)?<\/p>/.exec(_p.content)[1];
```

There may be no paragraphs. There may be a line break inside a paragraph. “Expect seven misfortunes” [etc.](http://hermetic.com/crowley/libers/lib148.html)
