This is my second attempt at 100 Days of Code. First went south pretty quick: I didn’t respect my body and my body got me sick for most of the August. Anyway, the project I’ve started long before that first attempt somehow still didn’t write itself, so here I go again.

Today I mostly did inventory on the docs, so [my repo](https://github.com/hoichi/chops) would look somewhat less shitty published. It’s still a mess, but I think I figured out the next problem. Thing is, all this time I’ve presumed all those pieces of data that start as a source `.md`s or `.jade`s and end up as `.html`s have enough in common to warrant a single type for all of it—even a class, maybe. But that’s a pretty big presumption. What if they have less in common than I think?

So, I think the next step is to write down what exactly do I expect to pass every step of the process?
